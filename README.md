# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This projects aims to apply software engineering best practices to a messy notebook. The goal is to create a library of functions to predict costumer churn. 

## Files and data description
Overview of the files and data present in the root directory. 

- `churn_library.py`: 
    A library of funtions to predict costumer churn. 
- `Churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`: 
    Testing scripts for functions contained in `churn_library.py` 
- Data: 
    Dorectory containing the input data in .csv format 
- models
    directory where trained models are saved. 
images: 
    ficgures created for exploratory data analysis and model results. 
logs: 
    directory containing log files created during testing of the developed scripts               

## Running Files
To use this library, you need to only run `churn_library.py`. The script will train a random forest model and a logistic regression model after performing the necessary preprocessing. 
You can use the churn_script_logging_and_tests.py script to test the churn_library script and observe the resuts in `logs/churn_library.log`
